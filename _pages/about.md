Hi! I'm **Alice Shirley**, a Data Scientist & Statistician passionate in translating complex data into meaningful takeaways 

Currently pursuing dual B.S. degrees in **Data Science** and **Statistics** at *Michigan State University*
- I’m especially interested in the intersection of biology and computing 

My experiences span:
- Academic instruction support in the Computation, Maths, Science & Engineering Department at MSU
- Supply chain and quality data analytics at Webasto
- Design with the MSU Formula SAE team

When I’m not analyzing data, I enjoy working on sports analytics problems and exploring how data technologies can positively impact cellular biology
