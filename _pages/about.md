# About Me

Hi! I'm **Alice Shirley**, a Data Scientist and Statistician passionate about translating complex data into clear insights.

Currently pursuing dual B.S. degrees in **Data Science** and **Statistics** at *Michigan State University*, I’m especially interested in the intersection of biology and computing, and I enjoy using programming and modeling tools to solve real-world problems.

My experiences span:
- Academic instruction support in CMSE at MSU
- Supply chain and quality data analytics at Webasto
- Engineering design with the MSU Formula SAE team

When I’m not coding or analyzing data, I enjoy working on engineering projects and exploring how tech can impact science and society.
